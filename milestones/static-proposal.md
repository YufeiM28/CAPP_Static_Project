## Description

I am planning to use datasets about K12 public education over the years to visualize changes in academic success, mental or physical health, policy implementation and other relevant areas. Additionally, I would like to explore whether there are any patterns in relationships between family involvement, school contribution, and student achievement. By making those graphs, I aim to not only form a basic understanding or introduction to public schools in the United States, but also to draw implications or insights in terms of how to improve the current educational system.


## Data Sources
### Data Source 1: Chicago Public Schools - progress Report Cards (2011-2012)

URL: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/chicago-public-schools-progress-report-cards-2011-2012

Size: 567 rows, 79 columns

This dataset comprises reports on school progress ratings from all 566 public schools in Chicago. The schools listed range from elementary to secondary. The ratings include a variety of variables, including teacher evaluation, parental engagement, and student performance. I have looked over it, and it is the most comprehensive dataset I have found in the field of public education. There are many approaches to investigate this dataset, such as examining changes between school levels (from elementary to high school) to determine whether parental participation decreased or increased. It might also be overlaid to the Chicago map to examine if the district schools' locations influence school expectations.

### Data Source 2: Chicago Public Schools- School Progress Reports SY1819

URL: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/chicago-public-schools-school-progress-reports-sy1819

Size: 655 rows, 182 columns

Similar to data source 1, this dataset included all public schools in Chicago from the 2018–2019 academic year. I included it as my second source because I want to compare it to the school year 2011-2012 after 7 years. I also included the data after another 6 years, which is a dataset from 2024 to 2025, so that I could display the changes in trials as in longitudinal research.

### Data Source 3: Chicago Public Schools- School Profile Information SY1819

URL: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/chicago-public-schools-school-profile-information-sy1819

Size: 655 rows, 94 columns

Different from earlier ones, this source collected information about admitted students’ backgrounds throughout the school year of 2018-2019. Two variables that I am particularly interested in are ethnicity and economic status. I am planning to merge this dataset with the progress reports in the same year period. Moreover, I would like to compare and see if there is any changing pattern in the student ethnicity ratio between 2018-2019 and 2024-2025.

### Data Source 4: Chicago Public Schools- School Progress Report SY2425

URL: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/chicago-public-schools-school-progress-reports-sy2425

Size: 650 rows, 183 columns

As mentioned above, I am planning to use this dataset to visualize changes across years. Even though it seems like there are a lot of columns stored in this dataset, there are a lot of empty columns that need to be cleaned. Also, I will be focusing on only relevant and meaningful variables rather than all of them. For instance, there is one column specifying the rate of college enrollment for all included high schools. I could compare the changes over years to see if there are more and more students attending higher education or the opposite.
