# Tracking Educational Trends in Chicago Public High Schools

Yufei Mao

## Description

This project provides a longitudinal analysis of Chicago Public High Schools from 2011 to 2024, examining how key academic and contextual factors have evolved over time. Using school-level performance data from CPS Report Cards, the analysis explores changes in graduation rates, college enrollment rates, average SAT scores, and attendance rates across three academic years (2011-2012, 2018–2019, and 2023-2024). In addition, it investigates potential factors—such as neighborhood safety and school resources—that may contribute to variations in student attendance and overall academic outcomes.
